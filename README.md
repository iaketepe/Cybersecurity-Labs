# Cybersecurity Labs

This repository showcases some of the cybersecurity labs I had completed during school. The labs had to be completed in the same class they were introduced, adding to the challenge of the lab work. 

These exercises covered topics such as packet capturing (Wireshark), secure remote access (SSH), port scanning (nmap), LDAP configuration, encryption, and various TCP/IP networking commands.

To set up the project the following tools were used: 

- **Virtualization Software: Virtualbox VM**

- **Linux Distribution: Ubuntu**

For a more in-depth guide on setting up and accessing these labs see the following links for more information:
